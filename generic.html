								<h2>Personal Information</h2>
								<p>My name is Thomas Jukes, Student number S3783616. I was born in Australia, but I'm a dual citizen, Britain being where I grew up. I'm a huge fan of Tabletop Roleplaying Games. I've always been interested in IT. It's such a huge part of our lives, and many people, businesses and even governments depend on it. And it's growing. It's an ever expanding field; and it will become more and more impressive as technology keeps developing. I'm personally interested in delving into the world of cybersecurity, protecting various clients from intrusion. As for experience, I've got exactly none.</p>
								<p>My name is Rafi Pincus, I am currently studying Information Technology at RMIT University enrolled with a student number of s3722015. I was born in South Africa and moved to Australia in 2009, when I was 10 years old. I graduated VCE in 2017 and took a gap year before deciding to study at RMIT. I really enjoy playing video games, most notably Overwatch right now. I also like to watch all sports with an oval ball or round ball, be it soccer, footy or NRL. My favourite of the 3 sports shifts depending on which of my teams between 'Melbourne Storm', 'Collingwood' or 'Manchester United' are doing the best in that point of time.</p>

<p>Hello everyone, my name is Calvin. Student ID:3778028.  I am from China and graduated from Monash college. I am a person who likes sports.

I especially like puppies, because I think puppies are natural good friends, so I am friendly with them.</p>
								<h2>Team Profile</h2>
<h3>Thomas</h3>								
<p>My Myers-Briggs Test gives me the result of an ENTJ-A, or 'Commander'. It gives me a good indication as to my personality type. Working in a team is a specialty of ENTJs, but knowing the results in and of itself won't influence my behaviour. I won't need to take my results into account when working in a team, beyond predicting what situations I'll be comfortable in.

As for the Learning Styles test, the results indicate that I'm a visual learner. This means little to me, I must admit. It doesn't really affect my behaviour in a team.

I did the "Dark Triad personality test" and my results ended up with 2.9 Machiavellianism, 2.1 Narcissism, and 1.8 Psychopathy. This means little to me, but it's interesting to see how much of me is manipulative. But hey, that's a good thing in the corporate world, right? I don't think it affects how I'd work in a work in a team.

<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
<h3>Thomas</h3>
<p> I want to work for ASIS, because who doesn’t want to be a spy? I want to work for my country, and use my skills to help people, if possible. But if I want to make *money*, I suppose I'd like to be a pentester, working as a white-hat hacker for corporate clients..</p>
<h3>Calvin</h3>
<p>My idea job is Web developer. This position is mainly to develop the company's software and design a series of services for the product. Most importantly, this position provides an effective solution for the most advanced payment methods and e-wallets.
This job attracts me because the welfare of this job is good, and this work will bring me a new working environment to enhance my personal ability. I chose this job position because of the flexibility of working hours.
</p>
<h3>Simon</h3>
<p>My ideal job potentially is a web developer, the pay is decent and it allows me to engage in the development of the World Wide Web. Whether it is for a company or just being self-employed being a web developer could be a passion of mine. </p>
<h3>Caner</h3>
<p>Im interested in the job title 'chief technology officer' as I'd like to be in a position were you have to take calculated risks especially when your held accountable to all managements on the technology aspects. I believe this is the perfect job title only after when I have had experience in the technology field in order to build my expertise and experience for the job. The high passion and likings i have for technology makes me believe I will be a perfect candidate for such a superior role. But I am aware I'll need to work and start from the bottom to earn my position. I've chosen this high role as my goal, so there is something I'm motivated about to help me work hard with passion in the tech fields.</p>
<h3>Alex</h3>
<p>The ideal job for myself would be in the field of information security. The position of security analyst at Peoplebank Australia monitor the network for security breaches and explore for a breach when a breach occurs. Security analysts must also protect sensitive information with the use of firewalls and data encryption programs. Security analyst at Peoplebank Australia is appealing to me because Peoplebank Australia is about the clients and as a security analyst, one has to provide security for the clients and utilises the skills learnt from university and more. The job advertisement is for Peoplebank Australia and the position requires people to have a good understanding of how internal and external networks communicate, have the ability to create and tweak rules and make sure that everything reaches specifications or requirements.</p>
<h3>Rafi</h3>
<p>My ideal job is to be a software developer as it can make a good amount of money and hopefully I won't get bored doing it either. I would like to work for a company that makes software for other businesses as I also enjoy the negotiating and business elements required to engage and sell to clients. </p>
