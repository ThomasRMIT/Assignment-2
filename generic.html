								<h2>Personal Information</h2>
								<p>My name is Thomas Jukes, Student number S3783616. I was born in Australia, but I'm a dual citizen, Britain being where I grew up. I'm a huge fan of Tabletop Roleplaying Games. I've always been interested in IT. It's such a huge part of our lives, and many people, businesses and even governments depend on it. And it's growing. It's an ever expanding field; and it will become more and more impressive as technology keeps developing. I'm personally interested in delving into the world of cybersecurity, protecting various clients from intrusion. As for experience, I've got exactly none.</p>

I especially like puppies, because I think puppies are natural good friends, so I am friendly with them.</p>
								<h2>Team Profile</h2>
<h3>Thomas</h3>								
<p>My Myers-Briggs Test gives me the result of an ENTJ-A, or 'Commander'. It gives me a good indication as to my personality type. Working in a team is a specialty of ENTJs, but knowing the results in and of itself won't influence my behaviour. I won't need to take my results into account when working in a team, beyond predicting what situations I'll be comfortable in.

As for the Learning Styles test, the results indicate that I'm a visual learner. This means little to me, I must admit. It doesn't really affect my behaviour in a team.

I did the "Dark Triad personality test" and my results ended up with 2.9 Machiavellianism, 2.1 Narcissism, and 1.8 Psychopathy. This means little to me, but it's interesting to see how much of me is manipulative. But hey, that's a good thing in the corporate world, right? I don't think it affects how I'd work in a work in a team.
</p>
<h3>Rafi</h3>
<p>My openness in the big five personality test and my prospecting trait in the Morrisby-Briggs test will help me work within a team environment as I will be able to hear different ideas and can implement actions for decision making and planning. However my agreeableness trait I will need to work on, as it would seem that I am not completely open to agree with other perspectives than mine which will impact my ability to work in a team as a team is all about working together and agreeing on the best method, even if they are not your own.
When working with our  team I should take these negative traits into account, as to find solutions to combat them, on the positive side I should embrace my extraversion by taking initiative in the team environment and building on ideas and motivating others.

</p>
<h3>Simon</h3>
<p>When approaching work, it should be displayed through visual and auditory means to allow for a more consistent understanding in key concepts. It seems most of my decisions are subconsciously through feelings rather than rational thoughts- which could cause internal issues both short and long-term. I’m more extroverted than introverted, therefore, communication will be more prevalent, which will allow for proper management, organisation and communication with my peers to allow for effective and efficient teamwork. In addition, being emotionally stable along with understanding my work peers feelings will allow for a common ground and create a strong relationship among others. Furthermore, being assertive and conscientious allows others to rely on me in times of hardship.

								Each of the tests don’t mean a whole lot to me, however they provide me with an idea of what kind of person I am and how others perceive me in public and such. These results shouldn’t influence my behaviour in a team as the tests are only an indication to what kind of person I am and shouldn’t affect the way I complete allocated tasks as I aim to complete the tasks within allocated time and not wait until it is very close to the deadline to finalise the task. When forming a team, I would use these results as a way to communicate with others, let them know what kind of person I am so that I won’t let the team fall behind.

<h3>Caner</h3>
<p>Myers-Briggs test-

 
My Myers-Briggs test has made me come to realisations of my weaknesses such as my sensitivity. This ultimately means alot to me as it's now going to allow me to ultimately understand when i'm frustrated or get upset over small things its from my weakness of being sensitive and to overcome it now when i face it. However based on my results, as an advocate I’m a great team player as Im motivated and can motivate and help others, based on the description of my Advocate personality. However I should be looking out for, being compromised by a more ethically relaxed colleague as this apparently causes an unhealthy version of me. So when I’m creating groups I’m meant to not be one where there is someone like that. Which will create negative synergy

Learning-style test -
 
I genuinely had an idea of myself excelling and being better when learning by the hands on method of actually doing the work physically rather than visually. This result is important for me i now know my prefered learning style, and this can help me identify and give the an edge ahead when needing to learn something new to start to physically doing it rather than trying to visualise the process. This result influences my group behaviour to be the one whom is hands whom tackles the task rather the one whom processes it mentally or visually. When taking this result as consideration for making a group I would surround myself whom strengths are my weaknesses such as someone is good visually or auditory to create a good balanced meta. 
The Big 5-personalities test -

 
This test is important for me as it gives me an overview of some of my aspects and on looks of some stuff. It shows to me that all by positives is greater then my weaknesses which makes me want to continue with the thoughts in my life the same way. These results prove to me that in a team environment I’m very agreeable and open therefore identifying I will get along fairly well with everyone and will be able to cooperate with my peers as accordingly. When taking this account
 in group works I believe I could be the one who is the one that takes leadership, as I’m strongly open allowing for everyone's ideas to be collaborated.
</p>
<h3>Calvin</h3>
<p>

●  The results of these tests are meaningful to me. These test results will allow me to intuitively
understand myself and I will be more aware of the appropriate role in the next task.

●  I think these results will affect my behaviour of assigning tasks in the team, because these results make me realize that everyone has his own unique personality. If you want to better complete the task we have to communicate with the team members.

●  When forming a team, I will consider working closely with my team members. I will refer to the results of the test, try to find my most suitable position in this task and make the greatest contribution.</p>

<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
<h3>Thomas</h3>
<p> I want to work for ASIS, because who doesn't want to be a spy? I want to work for my country, and use my skills to help people, if possible. But if I want to make *money*, I suppose I'd like to be a pentester, working as a white-hat hacker for corporate clients..</p>
<h3>Calvin</h3>
<p>My idea job is Web developer. This position is mainly to develop the company's software and design a series of services for the product. Most importantly, this position provides an effective solution for the most advanced payment methods and e-wallets.
This job attracts me because the welfare of this job is good, and this work will bring me a new working environment to enhance my personal ability. I chose this job position because of the flexibility of working hours.
</p>
<h3>Simon</h3>
<p>My ideal job potentially is a web developer, the pay is decent and it allows me to engage in the development of the World Wide Web. Whether it is for a company or just being self-employed being a web developer could be a passion of mine. </p>
<h3>Caner</h3>
<p>Im interested in the job title 'chief technology officer' as I'd like to be in a position were you have to take calculated risks especially when your held accountable to all managements on the technology aspects. I believe this is the perfect job title only after when I have had experience in the technology field in order to build my expertise and experience for the job. The high passion and likings i have for technology makes me believe I will be a perfect candidate for such a superior role. But I am aware I'll need to work and start from the bottom to earn my position. I've chosen this high role as my goal, so there is something I'm motivated about to help me work hard with passion in the tech fields.</p>
<h3>Alex</h3>
<p>The ideal job for myself would be in the field of information security. The position of security analyst at Peoplebank Australia monitor the network for security breaches and explore for a breach when a breach occurs. Security analysts must also protect sensitive information with the use of firewalls and data encryption programs. Security analyst at Peoplebank Australia is appealing to me because Peoplebank Australia is about the clients and as a security analyst, one has to provide security for the clients and utilises the skills learnt from university and more. The job advertisement is for Peoplebank Australia and the position requires people to have a good understanding of how internal and external networks communicate, have the ability to create and tweak rules and make sure that everything reaches specifications or requirements.</p>
<h3>Rafi</h3>
<p>My ideal job is to be a software developer as it can make a good amount of money and hopefully I won't get bored doing it either. I would like to work for a company that makes software for other businesses as I also enjoy the negotiating and business elements required to engage and sell to clients. </p>
<h2>Industry Data</h2>

<h2>IT Technologies</h2>
<h3>Rafi - Clouds, Services, Servers</h3>
<p><i>What does it do?</i>The cloud is not a new concept when it comes to computing it is actually just a metaphor for the internet. It is a virtual space that connects users from all over the globe, the internet is called a cloud as it's a way of sharing information via satellite networks. Cloud computing refers to sharing particular information over a network (the internet) it ranges from resources, software and information. This data is stored on physical servers which are maintained and controlled by computing providers, these are large companies such as Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google etc.</p>
 
<p>This technology has exploded in the last 8 or so years. Storing data and information on physical media such as DVD's or USB's was the most popular way to back up your data a few years ago, however as big companies can facilitate for low cost subscription network storage it has now become a lot easier for users to back up their data to the cloud rather than only physical media. This is mostly evident in Laptops, 8 years ago most laptops you would be able to buy would have a DVD drive slot as a lot of users had films and general data stored on discs. Now there are no current machines on the market that have an internal DVD drive. Why is that? Because discs are simply just not used anymore and take up too much space when it comes to the internals of a machine. Some manufacturers have taken this even further by removing all peripherals such as a USB slot, like Apples new MacBook's just having only USB-C slots, optimising the direction they want the future to go. Apple offers a iCloud storage solution which is subscription based and allows you to store any information on their network for a low monthly cost. This storage solution helps users who have a lot of devices and a lot of data spread across them, services like iCloud allow users to access their data whether it be on their phone, computer or even their TV. It allows for a secure method of backup as there is such a low possibility of hardware failure as it is not managed by the user but rather by the corporation as well as allowing for data to be accessed anywhere, anytime and on any device.</p>
 
<p>A big emerging use of cloud technology is streaming services, streaming services such as Netflix allow users to watch an abundance of content which takes up no storage on your device and can be accessed anywhere. It is pretty remarkable to see so many advancements in technology and what abilities cloud computing can have. The future looks brightest however with the development of video games. Video games are an extremely popular activity with today's generation and always seems to be growing, where all types of people around the world are playing it. The problem is that is quite an expensive hobby, you invest a lot of money into the hardware and then have to invest money into the video games which get outdated pretty quickly, whilst with consoles paying monthly subscription rates to be able to play online and with your friends. Google has recently announced an advancement in video games which could revolutionise the entire industry should it be done right. Google's announcement of Google Stadia promises to be a completely universal gaming streaming solution. Players will have the ability to play whatever they like, wherever they like on whatever device they like. 
</p>
<p><i>What is the likely impact?</i> 
Streaming services and subscriptions seem to go pretty hand in hand. It has been a great solution to the illegal distribution of media and content, where users consistently pay a monthly fee to gain access to specific content whenever and wherever they want. It would only make sense that this type of service would enter the video game sphere as well giving consumers an abundance of options to play video games. PC gaming can get very expensive as in order to achieve very high spec gaming you would need to have extremely up to date and fast hardware. Google Stadia answers this by putting the hardware on their end in their huge data centre and deliver it back to the user via streaming, so by streaming the content on any device you just need to have stable internet connection and a basic spec machine. It would allow for so many more gamers to come about as everyone would be able to play as long as they have internet and a device, it would also create jobs by helping out independent game developers get onto the platform as every game would be included under the subscription service the user can play whatever they like. Right now with video games the big companies such as EA rule the roost and it seems that the smaller companies cannot compete at all yet with a new service like this anyone can dream to make the next big thing and Google can help them facilitate that.</p>
<p><i>How will this affect me?</i> Video games are quite big in my day to day life, I find video games my number one choice when it comes to recreational entertainment. By having the ability to play on any device at any time would change the way I play video games. Streaming services as a whole seem to be the future of media and entertainment and therefore cloud computing and networking is in high demand for business and employers and is it is paving the way for distribution of content. This would also affect my friends whom I also play video games with as we can play together very easily as It would not matter what platform we choose to play the video game on allowing for any of us to play with whoever we meet at any time. I am a big supporter of the cloud and streaming services and think it can provide great things for technology in the future. As we learn more we can develop more and the only thing that can hold us back is what we limit ourselves to. For me then by this technology growing and expanding it would only be beneficial as it would create more jobs and new ideas.</p>
<h3>Caner Peler-  Blockchain and cryptocurrencies</h3>
<p><i>What does it do?</i> Blockchain is a technology, where digital information (blocks) are stored within a public database(Chain). The blocks within this technology store information about transactions, and this could be the date, time and possible dollar amount of a purchase you may make from a possible store. The block storing the information including the ones who are participating within the transactions, being the buyer and seller. The block would record your name with the alongside of the seller. For example if you purchased merch from rmit online. The block would store your (Your unique name, Rmit University). Instead of the traditional method of recording your actual name, the blockchain technology records it without any identity information from the buyer. However each block created is unique in a sense how everyone has their own names. This is completed via the blockchain by the 'unique code hash', which allows blocks to distinguish themselves from the others. If multiple orders a made, the blocks will look similar but however they will be separated by their hash. However in order for a blockchain to occur the following must be present. Most importantly a transaction must occur to create the block, the newly made digital information. Once the transaction is made in then goes through the verification process. This verification is made via several networks of computers. This could be thousands of networks spread across over the globe. For example bitcoin has 'about 5 million computer networks' said by investopedia. These networks of numerous computers securely check whether the transactions have occurred. Once the check is done, the networks of computers verify the transaction. As it is verified it then gets uploaded to the block, with is unique hash of course. Ultimately blockchain is a technology that provides an alternative to the traditional way of recording online transactions in a more decentralised, discreet and identity hidden manner. The existence of this technology blockchain, allows us to further create more technologically advanced things, such as cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is a form of digital currency in which it is supported and run by blockchain, allowing it to verify the transfers of occured funds independently from central banks making it decentralised. Ultimately this allows us to make secure transactions without any identity being recorded. This has most commonly brought to everyone's attention of one of the few forms of currency known as bitcoin. Due to the recent spike of cryptocurrency and blockchain. The popularity of cryptocurrency is not seen to be able to reach its peak again in short term of 3 years. However it likely to make another huge impact in the following 15 years. However for blockchain, it is being now widely spread and used by many more businesses and corporations.</p>
<p><i>What is the likely impact?</i> The potential impact of blockchain and cryptocurrency is deemed to be cryptocurrency to overtake and be the new form of currency we use as it will effectively replace our cash. However this is a extremely large goal to be achieved. At the very moment  cryptocurrency is being brought to a few retailers to help is growth in involvement into our daily lives. However i see crypto currency to most likely to be in charge of a portion of the current currency we have within the next 15 years. As i think it will take a lot longer to be in full charge. However for blockchain. It could be seen to be further involved and used in many more cases due to its intentions being favoured by the everyday consumers. If cryptocurrency succeeds it will obviously affect consumers and banks. This decentralisation will destroy banks as cryptocurrency is not supported by banks. Eventually closing banks and consumers also needing to be familiar with the digital currency as a new form of capital.</p>
<p><i>How will this affect you?</i>This wouldn't really affect me as much as i've been familiar and interacted with cryptocurrency for the past 3-4 years. However this will affect my daily interactions of purchasing in-store products. I'm not use to exchanging cryptocurrency for a product. For my family and most people out there, thay have little knowledge about cryptocurrency. Most people will find it difficult to moving from a solid, physical currency to a digital currency. And to how cryptocurrency can be gained by miners and the limit of how much of the currency can be overwhelming, especially the single value of bitcoin at the moment is, 1 = $7,737.34 AUD. 
So to introduce something technically advanced and new, will take a long time for people to get use to as our current currency is very different to crypto, therefore it is bound to create confusion and rejection by the society as they would be uncomfortable with this change. But for those who love technology would most likely happily go through crypto being out main type of currency.</p>
<h3>Simon (Machine Learning)</h3>
<p><i>What does it do?</i> </p>
<p><i>What is the likely impact?</i> </p>
<p><i>How will this affect me?</i> </p>

<h3>Thomas - Cybersecurity</h3>
<p><i>What does it do?</i> Cyber security is the art of protecting networks and systems from attacks. Cybersecurity is a growing field, mainly because crime a constantly evolving field of its own. Currently, most of our passwords are protected by SSH 256 bit encryption. It's good enough for a lot of people and companies, but as computer's processing speed increases, so too does the ease in which it decrypts said passwords. As computers develop which can crack codes more easily, the more security technologies need to advance. In terms of the technologies involved, there are many ways of protecting servers from hostile intrusion. Anti-malware and antivirus software; heavy duty firewalls... encryption and DNS filtering to protect users from receiving false data help... but the *true* magic happens when users are aware of the vulnerabilities of a system. </p>
<p>Among the greatest threats to a network is a canny social engineer turning the users against it. Hackers know that a system is only as strong as its weakest link; and with encryption being tough to crack for most people with out specialised software and tools, social engineering is something that's available for everybody! It doesn't matter how secure a system is if the people responsible for it give away sensitive information. 
However, when users comply with basic security concepts like choosing good passwords, and maintaining a good awareness of social engineering attempts; their security is all but assured. If the employees of a company protect the servers from *physical* access, and keep themselves security conscious, it's *very* difficult for a hacker to attack a network. Most IT departments encourage their workers to choose secure passwords, to not divulge them or personal information like credit card numbers, and to not trust suspicious email sources. 
 </p>
<p>
The advances of cybersecurity in the next three years depend on what's necessary. As mentioned above, as computers advance in their ability to process data and decrypt passwords faster and easier; the more unassailable our networks have to be. But the Internet of Things (IoT) increases *everyone's* connectivity. With so many appliances all connected to each other, virtually all of our personal data will be stored in one place; likely the Cloud. The interconnected nature of the IoT means that everything is a vulnerability. Thus, a high priority for cybersecurity is to increase security for the Cloud, where all the data is stored; or on individual 'things' in the IoT.
Of course for the most part, the technical developments that make all the advancement possible are simply improved versions of what we have now. Better processors, larger memory; better cooling for said processors so they can run for longer... But socially, people are more and more willing to give up their security to websites and companies. However, there was a recent surge of distrust in social media and what companies do with their users data earlier in 2018. Facebook's data breach affected around 87 million users. People being suspicious and wary of what can happen with their data increases demand for better security.
 </p>
<p><i>What is the likely impact?</i> With better security, networks and databases, particularly those holding important information will be breached less often. That means that law enforcement agencies can prevent leaks of personal information of agents in attacks such as the one in America on the 15th of April, 2019. The people most affected by the development of better security will likely be corporations. Big companies, or anything that makes enough money is a tempting target for hackers. Of course, with companies getting better security, the people connected to it are safer by extension, especially if the company holds their personal data in a central database. Cybersecurity's unlikely to *create*  jobs, beyond the people skilled in implementing or subverting the security system. In terms of replacement, computers do the security and encryption better than people anyway. It'd make our current technologies and experts therein redundant, but it's unlikely to be the impetus for broad, sweeping change. Of course, if society becomes more paranoid about their data and security, they could implement more Peer-to-Peer networks, relying on each other rather than a central server.</p>
<p><i>How will this affect me?</i> Honestly, very little. I already try to keep my data protected, avoiding posting personal information on social media and various other websites. I'm not a hacker, so increased Cybersecurity won't make my life *harder*. Perhaps, at the very most; advanced security technology might convince me to purchase better software... The average citizen won't see much difference in their daily life, and neither will my family and friends. Perhaps workplaces will implement harsher security measures, maybe it'll be a little less convenient to store passwords and personal data on websites so autofill can complete forms for you... but beyond that, I don't see much difference arising from something which protects users from cyber-crime. </p>

<h2>Project Idea (S.T.E.V.E)</h2>
<p>The security of systems and users have always been a concern of the manufacturing company. With the implementation of firewall by countless organisations and many programs designed to defend the system from malware and system optimisation for increased performance, security has become easier to manage. The means by obtaining such programs can either be for free or obtained by purchasing a subscription for a certain amount of time. However, utilising software that isn't already preinstalled on the computer and/or purchasing a subscription can be avoided if the user were to have the knowledge about the internet and how to utilise it without getting viruses or any of the nasty malicious software on the computer in the first place. </p>
<p>S.T.E.V.E (or STEVE), is a simple-to-operate program for users that can increase security on their systems to defend a system from intrusion, stop personal data being leaked through websites, emails, mobile data storage and so much more. STEVE, being a simple-to-operate program, is also a program for learning, STEVE will be equipped with a library of known scams and tactics, as well as the ability to recognise them. STEVE is able to alert the user to what the detected intrusion attempt is doing, and provide instructions on how to stop it or have an option to enable STEVE to defend against such intrusions automatically, whilst providing feedback and the process taken. It will also have the ability to scan any page, forum or application that requires the user give their personal data to. If STEVE detects certain issues with the page in question, such as bad grammar or references to international banks such as Western Union; it will warn the user. </p>
<p>From an industry standpoint, not all industries want to hire people to stay on-guard just to protect their information, especially when the database isn't very big and easier to manage, for bigger organisations, that may change. STEVE will be able to utilise machine learning to assist the growing or the big industries in their security. Provided that STEVE is not capable to provide all the aid that is required, STEVE will act as a barrier for the malicious attack from external ane/or internal sources. If STEVE is unable to act against the malicious attack, professionals would be required to resolve the attack. With so many websites taking data from their users, and corporations and governments spying on the people for their own sinister purposes, having an extra layer of protection is beneficial for corporate and personal use, to train and to protect.</p>
<p>Detecting the threats such as phishing, malicious software can prove itself to be difficult to most, if not, some users. Having STEVE will make detecting phishing and other known dangers seem trivial through its library of common tactics and schemes that scammers, companies and governments use to obtain personal information and what they do with it. Educating users whether or not they should trust something with their data is the goal for the creation of STEVE as a lot of people are unable to recognise such threats and fall into their trap and have their way with your personal information, whether that is to distribute it or to mess the user's system up. STEVE can only do what the user tells STEVE to do and is also limited to its capabilities. At the end of the day, it's up to the users to decide as to what to do when receiving warning messages, whether to trust and allow the software to pass through or not. This is not to say that STEVE will be an unbreakable shield for data as there will be ways to bypass everything, STEVE is there to educate and lend a helping hand when malicious software attacks.</p>
<p>STEVE is for industrial and personal usage, to educate and ultimately allow the users to become more conscious with their personal information and how they protect it if they do, both online and offline. Utilising STEVE to secure information for big and small will assist the general public enjoy a life with a lessened risk of having their data stolen.</p>
