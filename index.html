                                      <h2> Ideal Jobs</h2>
<h3>Thomas</h3>
<p> I want to work for ASIS, because who doesn't want to be a spy? I want to work for my country, and use my skills to help people, if possible. But if I want to make *money*, I suppose I'd like to be a pentester, working as a white-hat hacker for corporate clients..</p>
<h3>Calvin</h3>
<p>My idea job is Web developer. This position is mainly to develop the company's software and design a series of services for the product. Most importantly, this position provides an effective solution for the most advanced payment methods and e-wallets.
This job attracts me because the welfare of this job is good, and this work will bring me a new working environment to enhance my personal ability. I chose this job position because of the flexibility of working hours.
</p>
<h3>Simon</h3>
<p>My ideal job potentially is a web developer, the pay is decent and it allows me to engage in the development of the World Wide Web. Whether it is for a company or just being self-employed being a web developer could be a passion of mine. </p>
<h3>Caner</h3>
<p>Im interested in the job title 'chief technology officer' as I'd like to be in a position were you have to take calculated risks especially when your held accountable to all managements on the technology aspects. I believe this is the perfect job title only after when I have had experience in the technology field in order to build my expertise and experience for the job. The high passion and likings i have for technology makes me believe I will be a perfect candidate for such a superior role. But I am aware I'll need to work and start from the bottom to earn my position. I've chosen this high role as my goal, so there is something I'm motivated about to help me work hard with passion in the tech fields.</p>
<h3>Alex</h3>
<p>The ideal job for myself would be in the field of information security. The position of security analyst at Peoplebank Australia monitor the network for security breaches and explore for a breach when a breach occurs. Security analysts must also protect sensitive information with the use of firewalls and data encryption programs. Security analyst at Peoplebank Australia is appealing to me because Peoplebank Australia is about the clients and as a security analyst, one has to provide security for the clients and utilises the skills learnt from university and more. The job advertisement is for Peoplebank Australia and the position requires people to have a good understanding of how internal and external networks communicate, have the ability to create and tweak rules and make sure that everything reaches specifications or requirements.</p>
<h3>Rafi</h3>
<p>My ideal job is to be a software developer as it can make a good amount of money and hopefully I won't get bored doing it either. I would like to work for a company that makes software for other businesses as I also enjoy the negotiating and business elements required to engage and sell to clients. </p>

									<h2>Industry Data</h2>
								</header>
								Rafi: Industry Data
 
<p>1.    My job title for my ideal job was “Software developer”this was ranked 19thin the Burning Glass top IT job titles. It would seem to still be a fairly in demand job from employers and would provide useful skills to help businesses development.</p>
<p>2.    IT Skill set required;
Javascript programming skills
Python programming skills
Java programming skills
Javascript is the second most in demand skill for an IT professional, where Java programming is right below it in third position whilst Python is 22nd in demand.
These skills are important for me to learn as they are what employers are looking for when it comes to software development, I need to work on learning them to the best of my ability to ensure that I can earn good money and help clients in the business world.
General skill set required;<br>
-      Communication skills<br>
-      Problem solving<br>
-      Organisational skills<br>
-      Teamwork/Collaboration<br>
-      Troubleshooting<br>
 I find these skills the most important when working in IT they all rank within the top 10 of top general skills. I find them important as IT is very much a team environment job and these skills can help with teamwork and creating strong IT projects. As I would like to get into management eventually communication skills are very important. They are very much the sought after skills and given my experience with customer interactions from my previous jobs I feel that I am set up to develop strong communication skills and will be able to implement them into the business IT sphere.</p>
 
<p>
The three highest IT specific skills which are not in my skill set are;<br>
-      SQL Developer<br>
-      Microsoft windows<br>
-      Project management<br>
SQL developer is actually the most sought after skill in IT however I am not entirely interested in working within the database sphere so I feel like it is not really relevant to my path. Microsoft windows is more of a generic skill, so I feel like it is not entirely relevant to a software development job but rather just a generic IT job. Project management is more of a good general skill but not really specified for IT skills, it is a very important skill nonetheless and I would need it for developing a strong team and doing solid teamwork in the IT sphere.</p>
 
 
 
<p>The three highest general skills which are not in my skill set are;<br>
- Writing<br>
- Planning<br>
- Detail-oriented<br>
 
For software development writing I feel is not really relevant as most of the work is done on computers so physical writing would not really be relevant. Planning and detail oriented skills are still very important but I do not think they are as important as the skills I have mentioned previously are more relevant to my specified job path.</p>
 
<p>Looking at the data has made me more excited about entering the IT world as the skills I have chosen seem to be very sought after as well as the skills which I am not familiar with seem enjoyable to learn. Enjoying my job is very important to me so it would seem that I am on a good path for an occupation.</p>

     3) No it hasn’t, the the data that Burning Glass provided displayed information that i was very familiar with and had a general idea of. Seeking a job shouldn’t purely be based on salary and difficulty but rather passion.

Caner Peler:

Job titles for Ideal jobs
Solutions architect, ranked 1st in Burning class ’Top job Titles ‘. 2018

     2) Required skill set
For my job, the *general* skills 2018 required would be:
Communicating skills (#1), Problem solving (#2),  Organisational skills (#3),  Teamwork /collaboration (#5), Planning (#7), Creativity (#9), Leadership (#11), Presentation skills (#15)

And my *top IT skills* required 2018 required would be:
Business process (#25), Project management (#5), Business analysis(#9)

As seen above the most of my general skill sets required rank extremely very high in terms of demand from employees. My highest ranked skill is communicating skills which is ranked top 1 from burning class 2018. Followed by the rest of the required skills to be in the upper quartile as well, for high demand.

For my top IT skills the required skills are ranked fairly high as my highest valued skill is Project management ranked 5. As one of my required skills if fairly below the median, of required skills which is business process ranked at 25th. This is probably due to business being almost an entirely different skill set opposed to IT. As  the skills being ranked accordingly for IT skills and business is fairly distant.
The three highest ranked IT skills which are not in my required group is, Sql ranked 1, Javascript ranked 2 and finally Java ranked 3. These are the highest ranked top IT skills outside the group of my required skills.

On the other hand, the highest ranked general skills not included in my required skill sets are, writing ranked 4th, troubleshooting ranked 6th and detail oriented ranked 8th.


3) Has the data changed our opinion of our job?

No it hasn't. As i prefer to have an occupation im passionate about rather than doing something that is truly based on data and little to no value to me. However the job im interested is ranked 1, but this still doesn't change my current state of mind whether i’ll be pursuing this job or not.
